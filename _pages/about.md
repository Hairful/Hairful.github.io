I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at East China Normal University, majoring in Software Engineering. In 2023 fall, I went to UC Berkeley for a one-semester exchange.

I am interested in algorithm design. Python is definitely my favorite programming language for algorithm implementation, and I am also familiar with C++ and Java.

My personality is ENTJ:) Besides learning, I like hiking, playing soccer, and photographing.
