Welcome to the personal website of Allen Yang!
I am currently a third-year student at East China Normal University, majoring in Software Engineering. I am also an exchange student at the College of Letters and Science, UC Berkeley.

I am interested in the latest technologies.

I love playing soccer, hiking, photographing, and tasting different kinds of delicious foods!
