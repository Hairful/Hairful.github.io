I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at East China Normal University, majoring in Software Engineering. In fall 2023, I went to UC Berkeley for a one-semester exchange, where I am lucky enough to be enrolled in CS170, CS189, and EECS127.

My interest includes algorithms, machine learning, and optimizations. I am currently researching in Online Learning. Python is definitely my favorite programming language for algorithm implementation, and I am also familiar with C++ and Java.

My personality is ENTJ:) Besides learning, I like hiking, playing soccer, and photographing.
