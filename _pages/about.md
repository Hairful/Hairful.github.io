I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student at East China Normal University, majoring in Software Engineering. In fall 2023, I went to UC Berkeley for a one-semester exchange, where I am lucky enough to be enrolled in CS170, CS189, and EECS127.

My interest includes algorithms, machine learnings, and optimizations. I am currently researching in Online Learning. Python is definitely my favorite programming language for algorithm implementations, and I am also familiar with C++ and Java.

In May 2024, I secured my first internship as an R&D intern in the PAMA Group at ABB Engineering (Shanghai) Ltd. where I maintained a Windows desktop application (C++) and implemented unit testings on an embedded system software based on CMock.

I also serve as one of the Directors of the *Academic Development Department* of the *East China Normal University Student Union*.

My personality is ENTJ:) Besides learning, I like hiking, playing soccer, and photographing.
